#100DaysOfCode

On May 25, 2019, I committed to the [100 Days of Code Challenge](https://www.100daysofcode.com/) to practice and improve my coding and programming skills.

This repository contains the code and contents of the blog I am keeping along the way. In it, I write about what I'm working on and thoughts I'm having, as well as give examples of my work.

See my 100 Days of Code blog at [https://kjlarson.github.io/100-days](https://kjlarson.github.io/100-days).
