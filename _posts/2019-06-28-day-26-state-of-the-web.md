**Today's Progress:** I worked more on HTTP Archive's Web Almanac. One of the braches I created a pull request for was merged!

I also decided I wanted to create a site where I could put the bits of code that I'm always looking up over and over again. I started setting that up, but didn't get very far.

**Thoughts:** I feel like a real developer!
