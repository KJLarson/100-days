**Today's Progress:** I've been wanting to put together some sort of website to display some of my photography. Right now, I have a bunch of it on [Flickr](https://www.flickr.com/photos/plethora4834/), but I think it would be fun to make my own site! So, today I say down and did a bunch of research.

I found several JavaScript libraries that look promising, especially:
* [lightgallery.js](https://sachinchoolur.github.io/lightgallery.js/)
* [Natural Gallery JS](https://sachinchoolur.github.io/lightgallery.js/)
* [viewerjs](https://github.com/fengyuanchen/viewerjs)

I tried lightgallery.js today. First, I tried doing it myself from scratch in CodePen, working from the documentation. I couldn't get it to work.

I didn't want to give up, so then I looked at the [CodePen demo](https://codepen.io/sachinchoolur/pen/qNyvGW) that is linked to from the lightgallery.js GitHub page. I forked it so I could mess around with the code and try to figure out how it works. I changed one of the pictures (the others in my pen are still the same pictures from the demo), and deleted a bunch of code that I didn't need. Cool!

I kind of like the looks of photo galleries that display thumbnail images in a staggered layout rather than a perfect grid, and Masonry.js has piqued my interest for a while. So, next I added Masonry.js to the trial lightgallery.js photo page I had to see if they could work together. Lo and behold, they do! At least I think so! I added in another picture (the banana slicer from my FreeCodeCamp Product Landing Page). I got it to stagger...but sometimes pictures overlap. I still need to work on this more. It's an experiment in progress!

**Thoughts:** I know I've had a couple long(ish) breaks between the last couple days of coding, and that the official #100DaysOfCode challenge website says on the [FAQ page](https://www.100daysofcode.com/faq/) to never miss more than two days in a row, but...

"Never" is a strong word!

I need to adjust this challenge to fit my needs, my life, and the way my brain works. Sometimes, I need a break. And setting hard and strict rules for myself has lead me down some paths that don't serve me well in the past. I need to practice flexibility sometimes!

I haven't forgotten about web development over these breaks. I'm still reading articles, listening to podcasts, looking at CodePen, doing research, and applying for Web Dev jobs! I just haven't done as much actual coding.

I'm ok with how my challenge is going!
