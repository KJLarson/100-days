title: "Day 15: Modern JavaScript from the Beginning"

**Today's Progress:** I worked on Brad Traversey's [Modern JavaScript from the Beginning](https://www.udemy.com/modern-javascript-from-the-beginning/) today. A lot of it was review, as I was doing the fundamentals.

**Thoughts:** It would probably have been ok for me to skip some of the fundamentals videos, but I figured watching them would help solidify the concepts. Also, I want to complete the whole course.

**Links to work:** No live work today.
