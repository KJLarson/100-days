**Today's Progress:** Today I used HTML and CSS to replicate my Macbook Pro keyboard. For the layout, I used CSS Grid and CSS Flexbox: grid for placing the keys in the correct places and flexbox for the content of the keys.

Still to do:
    - Figure out the size of the keyboard
        - Should I use fixed height and width so the keys are the correct shape and size?
        - Should I try to make it responsive?
    - Alignment of some of the key contents
    - Find symbols for the rest of the function keys

**Idea for Future:** I wonder if it would be possible to make the keys into actual buttons so that when a user clicks on one the text appears on the screen. I think JavaScript might be able to do it.

**Thoughts:** This has been a pretty fun project. I'm pretty impressed with it so far.
