title: "Day 12: Modern JavaScript from the Beginning"

**Today's Progress:** I had been working on freeCodeCamp's [Javascript Algorithms And Data Structures Certification](https://learn.freecodecamp.org/), but today I switched to Brad Traversy's [Modern JavaScript from the Beginning](https://www.udemy.com/modern-javascript-from-the-beginning/) course on Udemy. I watched seven of the videos in "Section 2: JavaScript Language Fundamentals." A lot of it was review, since I started the JavaScript training on freeCodeCamp (and I think I've probably tried learning it other times, too).

**Thoughts:** I think I learn better, at least initially, by watching videos and following along. The explanations that instructors give seem to stick better in my head, and I feel when they are speaking rather than writing they tend to explain ideas in more than one way. Hearing the process of why they are writing the code they are writing is also helpful for me.

After I watch one or more videos and have the basic concepts down, then I'm usually ok with following written instructions or learning by reading.
