title: "Day 5: freeCodeCamp: Tribute Page and Survey Form"
date: 2019-05-31

**Today's Progress:** Today, I tackled my Tribute Page for freeCodeCamp again. I was able to figure out how to make the HTML tag changes that I couldn't on [day 4]({{ site.baseurl }}/2019/05/29/day-4-free-code-camp). The problem I was having involved the `timeline-items::before` CSS selector, as I didn't have a `position` set for `timeline-items`. Once I did that, the vertical line down the height of the timeline move down so it didn't overlap the timeline's heading. I made a couple adjustments to some margins, and then I decided to call this project done (at least for now). I submitted the passing project.

After finishing the tribute page, I started the next Responsive Web Design Project on freeCodeCamp: [Build a Survey Form](https://learn.freecodecamp.org/responsive-web-design/responsive-web-design-projects/build-a-survey-form). I built almost the whole form, and only have a few more requirements to add. Here's what it looks like so far (the hamburger menu in the top left corner is freeCodeCamp's testing tool):

**Thoughts:** At first I didn't really feel like coding today. I was tired and kind of distracted. Once I began, however, I got into it and enjoyed working on the projects.
