title: "Day 8: Survey Form and Macbook Keyboard"
date: 2019-06-03

**Today's Progress:** I finished up my Build a Survey Form project on freeCodeCamp. I added the checkboxes, text area, and submit button. Then I added some styling.

I also worked more on the Macbook Pro keyboard I started yesterday. I fixed the alignment on some of the keys. I feel like the CSS is getting kind of messy, so I will have to go back and try to clean it up. The padding/spacing/alignment is acting weird on several of the keys, and that's bugging me. I can't figure out why on some of the keys (like fn and control) the text is at the very bottom, but on others (like alt-option and command) there is more space between the text and the bottom of the key. It must have something to do with the number of lines of text in the key, but I can't figure it out. The developer tools say there isn't any margin or padding there. I'm stumped.

**Thoughts:** I need to do my hour of code earlier in the day, because I'm tired at 8:40 pm and don't want to write about what I worked on.
