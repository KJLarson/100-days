**Today's Progress:** I worked on a variety of projects today:
* Tried troubleshooting the fart pen some more, but couldn't resolve the issue on mobile. Not all the content shows in live view, so I can't scroll. Discovered that I can see all the content if it's in debug or fullscreen views, but I can't hear the noises. I looked for sound setting for iOS Firefox and Safari, but couldn't find any.
* Started a pixel art project following the instructions in [Creating Pixel Art with CSS](https://dev.to/jnschrag/creating-pixel-art-with-css-3451) by Jacque Schrag. Link to pen can be found below -- can you guess what it's going to be?
* Figured out how to use [highlight.js](https://highlightjs.org/) to add sytanx highlighting to code blocks (which I added to this blog).


**Thoughts:** I probably have too many projects going. My mood affects my concentration levels, and sometimes it's difficult to work on the things I already have started. Deep learning isn't always possible. So, in an effort to continue practicing coding of some sort, I find a project that suits me for the day. There's also so much that I want to learn that I find myself jumping around and trying new things.
