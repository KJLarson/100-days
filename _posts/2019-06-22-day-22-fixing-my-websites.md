**Today's Progress:** Today, I made some changes on a couple of my sites that I've been meaning to do:
* Web Portfolio:
  * Added my Twitter and GitHub profiles to my Contact page
  * Redid the layout for my contact information. I used CSS Grid to line up the icons and links, which I think looks nicer.
  * Removed the link to my CodePen profile
  * Figured out how to hook Git up to my server (DreamHost), so now I just have to push changes to the remote repository rather than entirely replace the files using SFTP (I've been using Cyberduck 2). Using Git is so, so much easier. Once I push the files to the server, my webpage automatically updates!
* 100 Days of Code Blog:
  * Redid the layout for the page that lists my blog posts. I used CSS Grid here as well to line up the dates and post titles. It looks much cleaner now.

**Thoughts:** I really like being able to update my webpages through Git/GitHub. It makes it so easy. I had small changes I wanted to make on my web portfolio, but have been putting them off, in part because I didn't feel like taking the extra step to open up Cyberduck and move files around. Hooray for Git!!!!
