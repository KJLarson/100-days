**Today's Progress:** 
* Gatsby on CodeSandbox
  * I played with Gatsby some more on CodeSandbox. I wanted to add a blog page to the site I was messing with yesterday, but ended up just making a new sandbox with a blog.
* HTTP Archive Almanac
  * Went back to the code I wrote the other day. Made a few changes to make it match the existing project code. Did more research.
* I was looking for a set of icons for all the programming languages (to eventually add to my web portfolio), and I accidently found the icons I was missing for the MacBook Pro keyboard I made on CodePen. I decided to add a couple to see how it worked/looked.
  * At first, I added the icons by including the SVG files, but then I figured out how I could copy the code from Affinity Designer, so I switched to putting the code right in the HTML. I think that works better.

**Thoughts:** I didn't really mean to work on so many different things today; it sort of just happened. My brain was definitely tired by the end of it. As I was working on the Almanac, I started feeling sort of anxious and overwhelmed. I decided it was time to step away from it for the rest of the day. With this project, I'm simultaneously feeling proud of myself for figuring stuff out, excited to be working on it, and feeling inadequate and that I don't know enough. I have to remind myself that I'm learning...I wanted to work on an open source project to learn! I can't know everything (at least not right away, ha ha)!
