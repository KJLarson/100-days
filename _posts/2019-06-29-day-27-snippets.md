**Today's Progress:** I worked on a site to store bits of code that I keep looking up, over and over again. It was fun. I forked a repo from [Tania Rascia](https://github.com/taniarascia/js) that I really liked, and worked off of that.

The most difficult part for me was figuring out where the header and footer background color was applied. I looked through all the SCSS files multiple times. I finally realized that it was added as a `background-image` to the `body`. That's why I couldn't find it...I was looking for `background-color`!

**Thoughts:** I have a feeling the organization of this site will evolve as I add more code snippets to it, but this works for what I have now!
