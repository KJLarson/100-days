title: "Day 18: State of the Web (The Web Almanac)"
date: 2019-06-18

**Today's Progress:** A couple weeks ago, I decided I wanted to try to work on an open source project so I could get more experience, possibly learn new tools/technologies, and build my portfolio. I looked around and came across HTTP Archive's annual "state of the web" report, The Web Almanac. It's the first year of the Almanac. I asked the lead contributor/developer (I'm not sure what to call him), [Rick Viscomi](https://github.com/rviscomi) if he thought there would be any ways a new developer could contribute to the web development team (there are also teams of authors and analysts), and he was very welcoming. I decided to give it a try, and after watching people getting organized for the various chapters, I was finally able to start working on something!

Rick opened an issue on the GitHub repository for generating a contributors page from a JSON file of data and tagged it as a "good first issue." He also sent me a message asking if I would be interested in working on it. I said that I would love to give it a try.

We're building The Almanac with Python and Flask. I have some experience with Python, but never used Flask before today. I spent some time doing research about Flask and examining the files that people have already added to the GitHub repository for The Almanac. After I thought I had an idea of how the templating works, I started figuring out how to write some code. I worked on paper, though, as I often think better that way than I do on a screen, and I haven't typed it up yet. I'm not sure yet how to test it on a local environment, so I don't know if my code will actually work. I also need to figure out how to connect the html file with the JSON file. I think I know how to incorporate the variables into the HTML, though.

I also spent some time making sure I know how to use Git and GitHub in a collaborative environment, as I've only used it for personal projects and in learning/training environments. I followed the steps in the [First Contributions](https://github.com/firstcontributions/first-contributions) repository to make a pull request. Then, I created the contributors.json file for The Almanac (leaving it empty) and went through the same steps to create a pull request to add the file to The Almanac's repository. Adding an empty file felt like a safe way to make sure I was doing it correctly, and it seems like I was (someone replied to the comment I left saying it looked good).

**Thoughts:** This is exciting!
