**Today's Progress:** Today, I worked more on the code for the Contributors page of The Web Almanac. I got some helpful feedback from other members of The Almanac team, and Rick gave me a brief list of the parts needed to get the data to the webpage (as well as some examples to look at). I came up with the following code, but I still want to do a little more work on it. Just not today, because I'm tired and think I need to step away from it for a bit.

Example of the layout of the JSON file that will store the contributor data:
<pre><code>
{
  "contributors": [
    { 
      "name": "John Doe",
      "teams": "Developer",
      "github": "github.com"
    },
    { 
      "name": "Sara Smith",
      "teams": "Analyst",
      "github": "github.com"
    }
  ]
}
</code></pre>



**Thoughts:** I got some helpful feedback from other members of The Almanac team about the work I did yesterday.
