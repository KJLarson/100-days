**Today's Progress:** I made some final adjustments to my 100 Days of Code blog. I added a link to my Twitter account and made my navigation bar responsive.

After finishing that up, I finished doing the exercises for the [freeCodeCamp.com Responsive Web Design Certification](https://learn.freecodecamp.org/) and started the first project: [Build a Tribute Page](https://learn.freecodecamp.org/responsive-web-design/responsive-web-design-projects/build-a-tribute-page). I built a page about Fred Rogers using their CodePen template. I got my page so it would pass all the tests, but I didn't like how it looked. I started messing around with the layout. I added CSS grid to the layout, and that worked ok. But then I tried changing some of the HTML tags for the timeline I included (I found an example online). The tags worked well for a standalone page, but when I added it to my page there was a header in the middle of my code. I was trying to make it more semantically correct. I ended up with this:

![Screenshot of tribute page]({{ site.baseurl }}/assets/tribute-page-2019-05-29.png)

At this point, I was stuck and tired so I decided to leave it like that and come back to it later.

**Thoughts:** I like that freeCodeCamp has projects at the end of the exercises. It's very different actually building something than it is just doing what a tutorial tells you to.

**Lessons Learned:** Use the fork feature on CodePen as a version control tool, at least at critical junctures. I didn't do this after I had layout that was ok (but not good), and now I only have a layout that is messed up. It would have been nice if I had forked it before I started adding grid and changing tags.
