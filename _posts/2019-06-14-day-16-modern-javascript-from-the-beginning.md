title: "Day 16: Modern JavaScript from the Beginning"

**Today's Progress:** I worked on Brad Traversey's [Modern JavaScript from the Beginning](https://www.udemy.com/modern-javascript-from-the-beginning/) again today. I finished the fundamentals section and moved on to DOM Manipulation & Events.

**Thoughts:** I'm excited to be moving on in the course. I spent quite a bit of time today working on it.

Today, I also came across [Zim.js](https://zimjs.com/). It looks really fun, but I didn't really do anything with it besides look around the website.. 

**Links to work:** No live work today.
