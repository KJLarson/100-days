title: "Day 30: Photo Gallery and Isotope.js"

**Today's Progress:** I worked more with yesterday's photo gallery today. I added a few more API options, and changed all the pictures to adorable cats.

I also worked with [Isotope.js](https://isotope.metafizzy.co/). It looked like a cool way to add filters to a collection of items, and I wanted to try it. I worked on a CodePen about food, where I would put each food item into categories. I looked at the docs and CodePen examples, but for some reason wasn't able to make the filtering work yet. I need to return to this project.

**Thoughts:** There are some really fun JavaScript libraries! I'm hoping that finding some that sound interesting to me and then trying to use them will help me get a better handle on how JavaScript works.
