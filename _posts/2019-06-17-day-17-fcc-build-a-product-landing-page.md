title: "Day 17: FCC: Build a Product Landing Page"
date: 2019-06-17

**Today's Progress:** Today, I worked on freeCodeCamp's Responsive Web Design Project [Build a Product Landing Page](https://learn.freecodecamp.org/responsive-web-design/responsive-web-design-projects/build-a-product-landing-page).
I decided to make a page for the Hutzler 571 Banana Slicer (which has amazing reviews on Amazon). I decided on what information to add to the page, and started building it with HTML and CSS. When I stopped, my page passed 7 out of the 16 tests to pass the exercise.

**Thoughts:** This has been my favorite of the Responsive Web Design Projects so far.
