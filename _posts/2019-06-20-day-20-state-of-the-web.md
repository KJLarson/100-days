**Today's Progress:** I worked more on the HTTP Archive Web Almanac project today. I filled the empty JSON file from the other day with a data structure and some sample data.

I also did some research on GatsbyJS, Netlify, and using them to create a portfolio. I used CodeSandbox to play around with a Gatsby template, to see what kinds of things I could figure out how to do. I didn't really make anything--just did some experiementing.

**Thoughts:** I really want to redo my web portfolio using Gatsby and Netlify. I think it would be much easier to maintain, and it sounds fun! I think I might have to wait, though. I have quite a bit on my plate already with the Almanac project, the JavaScript course I'm working on, looking for my first web development job, and going to my current job every day. But...maybe a new portfolio would help me get a job?

There's so much I want to do!!!!!!!!!
