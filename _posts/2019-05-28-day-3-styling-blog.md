**Today's Progress:** I spend most of my coding time today styling my 100 Days of Code blog on GitHub pages. I don't plan on making it too fancy (at least not right away), but I want it to look at least decent. I was working with the CSS most of the time, but did also add a bit of content to the home page for my blog. I just have a few more adjustments to make, and then I should be satisfied enough.

**Thoughts:** I like working with CSS. It can be tricky at times to get things to look and/or work the way you want them to, but I love the visual design element.
