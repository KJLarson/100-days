title: "Day 28: A Variety of Things"

**Today's Progress:** I tried working on a variety of things today, but was having difficulties concentrating on anything.

I worked on Brad Traversey's [Modern JavaScript from the Beginning](https://www.udemy.com/modern-javascript-from-the-beginning/), but didn't get too much farther than I was when I started the day.

Then, I tried figuring out how to make [Pok√©API](https://pokeapi.co/) work, but was unsuccessful with that. This was the second time I looked at it without figuring out how to use the API. The first time I tried, I attempted it in CodePen and CodeSandbox, but couldn't do it in either. I thought maybe it would work better in a local environment on my computer, so that's what I tried today. Still couldn't do it.

**Thoughts:** Coding when your brain isn't functioning well is difficult!
