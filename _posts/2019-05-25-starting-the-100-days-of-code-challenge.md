# Day 1: Starting the 100 Days of Code Challenge

I really could have started this challenge a week or two ago, as I've been doing some coding just about every day. But, now I'm officially beginning.

Today, I started reading Jon Duckett's <cite>JavaScript & jQuery: Interactive Front-end Web Development</cite>. I've had teh book for a while, and decided to start going through it.

I also spent time setting up this blog on GitHub pages. It's my first time making a site on GitHub and my first time using Jekyll. I followed the instructions on [Creating and Hosting a Personal Site on GitHub](http://jmcglone.com/guides/github-pages/), which were very helpful. Most of it worked for me, but I had to do some troubleshooting because the instructions were setting up a user page, and I was setting up a project page. My CSS file wasn't connecting to my homepage, but it worked for my blog-list page. I ended up finding out (from a search that led me to [Project Page URL Structure](https://jekyllrb.com/docs/github-pages/#project_page_url_structure)) that I couldn't just use a regular relative link.

I also used [Markdown Guide](https://www.markdownguide.org/) to write this post, as I don't have a lot of experience using this markup language.
