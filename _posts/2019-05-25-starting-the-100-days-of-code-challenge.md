title: "Day 1: Starting the 100 Days of Code Challenge"

I really could have started this challenge a week or two ago, as I've been doing some coding just about every day. But, now I'm officially beginning.

Today, I started reading Jon Duckett's <cite>JavaScript & jQuery: Interactive Front-end Web Development</cite>. I've had teh book for a while, and decided to start going through it.

I also spent time setting up this blog on GitHub pages. It's my first time making a site on GitHub and my first time using Jekyll. I followed the instructions on [Creating and Hosting a Personal Site on GitHub](http://jmcglone.com/guides/github-pages/), which were very helpful. Most of it worked for me, but I had to do some troubleshooting because the instructions were setting up a user page, and I was setting up a project page. My CSS file wasn't connecting to my homepage, but it worked for my blog-list page. I ended up finding out (from a search that led me to [Project Page URL Structure](https://jekyllrb.com/docs/github-pages/#project_page_url_structure)) that I couldn't just use a regular relative link. I was also having problems making my blog-list page link to this post. I used the Project Page URL Structure article to fix this problem, as well.

I also used [Markdown Guide](https://www.markdownguide.org/) to write this post, as I don't have a lot of experience using this markup language.

Well, it ended up being a long day of working on this blog. The instructions I followed created a site directly on GitHub. I wanted to set up a local environment with Jekyll so that I could see my changes before committing them. I did some research, and discovered the version of Ruby that came on my MacBook Pro was too old for what I needed to do. I tried updating it, but it wouldn't work. I did a whole bunch of searching and tried a ton of things, but I just couldn't do it. I kept getting the result "Error running '__rvm_make -j4'" and it would tell me to look at one of the logs. **I didn't understand any of it.** Finally, I search using the right terms terms from the log and found the [Stack Overflow question/answers](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/54132958/unable-to-install-any-ruby-with-rvm-on-macos-10-14-2-mojave-error-running-rv) that solved my problems (it had to do with Mac OS updates). It took a long time to follow all the steps, but I finally got everything working!!! I feel like a wizard!

So, I spent a lot of time on web dev related stuff, but not necessarily coding. I think this was still really helpful, though, because it helped me understand some of the necessary set-up stuff.
