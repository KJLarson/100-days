# Day 1: Starting the 100 Days of Code Challenge

I really could have started this challenge a week or two ago, as I've been doing some coding just about every day. But, now I'm officially beginning.

Today, I started reading Jon Duckett's <cite>JavaScript & jQuery: Interactive Front-end Web Development</cite>. I've had teh book for a while, and decided to start going through it.

I also spent time setting up this blog on GitHub pages. It's my first time making a site on GitHub and my first time using Jekyll. I followed the instructions on [Creating and Hosting a Personal Site on GitHub](http://jmcglone.com/guides/github-pages/), which were very helpful. I also used [Markdown Guide](https://www.markdownguide.org/) to write this post, as I don't have a lot of experience using this markup language.
