**Today's Progress:** Today, I finished setting up my local dev environment for Drupal 8. Now I'll be able to play around with it and start getting to know it better. I started looking through the theming documentation, but didn't really try anything yet.

I also added the code from Head Home to [GitHub](https://github.com/KJLarson/head-home). I looked back on the list I made of improvements I want to make to the website, and started trying to figure out how I could add a map to the site that is connected to its database. I looked through the documentation for [OpenStreetMap](https://www.openstreetmap.org/#map=12/44.9839/-93.2760) and [OpenLayers](https://openlayers.org/), and made a couple test Pens with maps in them. I didn't end up figuring much out, though.

**Thoughts:** I'm really tired today after a long few days of learning and fun. I went to day 2 of TC Drupal Camp on Friday. I didn't count it as part of my 100 Days of Code challenge, as I didn't do any coding or web development work myself, but I learned a lot of valuable information about Drupal and web development. It's really difficult to code when I'm tired.
