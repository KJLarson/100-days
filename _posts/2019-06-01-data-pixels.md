**Today's Progress:** I took a break today from my usual projects, and tried to get [Data Pixels](https://github.com/gmattie/Data-Pixels) working on my computer. DataPixels.js and Data Pixels Playground desktop application can be used to "create pixel art programmatically." When I came across Data Pixels, I thought it sounded really cool. I followed the instructions for installation, and was able to get a browser version of the playground working (from a local server), but I couldn't make the application work. I'm bummed about this because the browser version doesn't have all the functionality that the application is supposed to have. I looked at the issues on the project's GitHub repository, and other people seem to have had the same problems I was having (the application installed, opened, had a menu bar, but no windows would show). I wasn't able to fix the problem from what I saw, however.

Here's the simple text picture I made in the browser version of the playground:

**Thoughts:** There wasn't a lot of actual coding today, but I think I can still count this work. I used the command line (npm and other stuff), installed/built a package on my local environment, worked with GitHub, and practiced trouble-shooting. Those are all important skills to practice.

**Links to work:** No live link for today's work.
