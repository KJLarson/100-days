**Today's Progress:** Today, I attended Training Day at TC Drupal Camp. The training session I went to was called *Get Started Building Sites with Drupal*. We learned some of the basics of building a site using Drupal 8. I learned about adding content, creating content types, creating views, etc. I also started setting up a local dev environment, but didn't have time to finish.

I dabbled a bit with Drupal 6 or 7 (I'm not sure which) during a previous internship, but I didn't get too deep into it, as I was just fixing links.

**Thoughts:** Learning about Drupal makes me want to build a real site with the CMS! I don't think that my plan on DreamHost is great for Drupal, though. I'll have to look into it again. The organization I would really like to work at uses Drupal to build most of their sites, so I would like to get more practice with it.
